# traffic-sim

This is a simple traffic simulation module with a focus on performance and realism.

This is a personal project, with currently poor documentation and is not quite feature complete.

## Goals

The goal of this package is to be capable of simulating any road network in a realistic manner,
with reasonable performance. This includes simulating things such as:

* Car following
* Lane-changing decisions and dynamics
* Yielding at give way/stop signs
* Merging and diverging
* Simple path finding

The primary gap right now is the lack of a lane-changing.
There are pieces in place, but it is in general a very hard problem to solve.
