- Add "awake" flag to links
  - Sets to `false` when there are no vehicles on or entering the link
  - This is detected when `iter_vehicles_rev` is invoked on the link and nothing is found
    - Can the 40m distance limit be removed?
  - When a vehicle enters a link it sets the flag back to `true`
  - A conflict point only needs to be processed if both its links are awake
- Implement simulation step that applies per vehicle:
  - Vehicle examines next un-entered link
  - If it is a red light/stop etc. it applies decelleration
  - It determines if it should enter the link and then does so
- Check that vehicles have always entered the link they're currently on
