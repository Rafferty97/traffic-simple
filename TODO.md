- Remove hard coded constant of 30m in `conflict.rs`
- Implement better conflict detection
  - Use polygons to calculate exact `min_pos` and `max_pos`
  - Use maximum of entry and exit angles to determine padding factor (currently just 2.0 * LINK_RADIUS)
- Perhaps vehicles, upon entering a link, can "awaken" the conflicts on that link?
  - When conflicts have no vehicles to process they can "sleep"?
  - Or perhaps easier to awaken/sleep the links themselves?
