- Documentation and refactoring
- Lane changing AI
  - Improve lane cost function
    - Customisable?
  - Don't consider lane changes every `step`
  - Don't exit if `can_exit` is false
  - Better implementation of `can_reach_link`
  - Allow re-routing if the vehicle gets stuck
  - Use `fast_paths` crate?
- Better gap acceptance
  - Important for roundabouts
- Smoother merging
- Idea: Assign each end of a link a "node ID" rather than relying on `connect_links`?
